#Mathematics Core

This is a self-contained Mathematical Library without any external
dependencies. The aim of this project is to help me understand the
basics better. By building everything from the ground-up (except the
basic arithmetic supported by BigInteger and BigDecimal), I am hoping
to get a grasp on the various concepts of algebra and co-ordinate
geometry.

There are absolutely no guarantees that the algorithms are correct or
final. There will be errors. I will fix them. (You are more than welcome
to help me by making a fork and correcting my mistakes.) Sometimes
I may feel that the algorithms I am using are not performing well enough,
so I may use better ones.
